# The Basics

## 1. Read the Recipe First

It is easy to get carried away by the baking impulse
when you see the tempting image of a luscious cake in
a magazine or recipe book.
However, it is vital to rea a recipe all the way through
before you start.
The main question to ask yourself are:
"Do I have all the ingredients?" and
"Di I have time to make this?"

## 2. Room-Temperature Eggs

Using room-temperature eggs, even the recipe does not
specifically call for theem, is particularly important,
when you need volume in a cake or dessert.
This is because room-temperature eggs can be whisked
more easily, resulting in a light, airy texture.

## 3. Softened Butter

Baking recipes often call for softened or room-temperature
butter.
When this is the case, take the  butter out of the
refrigerator at least 30 minutes before you start baking.
Softened butter creams more easily with sugar, creating
a light, fluffy texture with little effort.
